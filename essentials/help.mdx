### Contact support

Reach out to Layouts support by clicking on the Profile button in navigation and than clicking on _Contact Support_.
You can also get in touch by emailing us directly at support@creative-robots.ai or by sending us a message in our [Discord](https://www.discord.com) community. 

### Discord community 

We also recommend joining our Discord community to meet other Layouts users and exchange tips. The whole Layouts team is in Discord so it's a great place to ask questions.

The community is also a good place to report #bugs, share #product-feedback, and to get #help from Layouts community.
