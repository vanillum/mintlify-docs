Layouts is web editor for building TailwindCSS projects. Built for a realtime, multi-screen and multi-device development experience.
Here's a quick summary of key focus areas within Layouts to help orient yourself:


## Layouts UI

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Editor" icon="Text">
  The editor is the life-blood of Layouts. It is where you'll be primarily living when building projects and making code changes.
  Write both HTML and apply TailwindCSS classes here to start watching your design come to life. Within the editor, try using our keyboard shortcuts to help speed up your workflow.  

 <img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/images/editor_graphic.svg"
  alt="Hero Light"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/editor_graphic.svg"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>


  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Docs Panel" icon="book">
     Included in Layouts is a documentation panel that's context-aware, meaning if you click on any component or Tailwind class in the editor, the relevant documentation will populate in your docs panel. This includes native Layouts, TailwindCSS and HTML docs. 
   <img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/images/docs_graphic.svg"
  alt="Hero Light"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/docs_graphic.svg"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>

  </Accordion>

   <Accordion title="Preview" icon="desktop">
    Any changes you make within the editor will render real-time in the Preview panel in Layouts. 
    Open your Layouts URL on any device or any screen and it's content will change live as you make changes to your code. 
    Project URLs work like this: 

      - `https://layouts.dev/<pageId>`: See the page
      - `https://layouts.dev/<pageId>/edit`: Open the editor for the page
      - `https://layouts.dev/<pageId>/doc`: Open the contextual doc
      - `https://layouts.dev/<pageId>/code`: See the code output (HTML or React)

    </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Code" icon="code">
Whenever you're ready to export your page, by clicking on the Code panel in navigation, you'll have the ability to export well-engineered HTML or React (if on [Pro Plan](https://layouts.dev/pricing)) code.

## The basics

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Layouts Syntax" icon="code">
 <img

  We use a more concise version of HTML for building in Layouts. This allows for ultimate flexibility and creativity in the editor. 
  Components are represented by a line beginning with `/componentName`. We use tabulations to structure the components of the page into a tree of parent and children components. 
  
  In the example below, both `/button` and `/div` are components.`/button` is the child of `/div` and therefore it will be placed inside it. 
  
  Instead of writing: 
  ```
  <div class="bg-indigo-100" >
	<button>
		Hello
	</button>
</div>
```
You write: 
```
/div bg-indigo-100
	/button Hello
```

After the `/componentName`, you can apply a number of different properties including:
    - Type any Tailwind classes and they’ll be recognized as such. For example, write `bg-indigo-900`
    - Type any other CSS class using the format `.customClassName`
    - Specify variants for components using `%variantName` syntax
    - Add attributes like `@type=button` or `@title=”Title with spaces”` which will be equivalent to HTML attributes like `<div type=”button” ></div>`
    - Bind a variable to a component by using `$variableName`
    - Any plain text will be recognized as a text-string and placed as a child of the component

To summarize, type any valid HTML component and you can use any Tailwind class on it. Style away!

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Keyboard actions" icon="keyboard">
     - Type `/` to see a slash menu and search for components
     - Select any Tailwind class or variant name and press `Shift + Up` or `Shift + Down` to see the other possible values. 
     - Write `>>>` after a component tag to paste it's reference implementation. 

    Once you're in your Project's dashboard, you'll navigate to the Actions panel to generate a new 'action'. In the the input field, describe what you want your button to do, and AI will take care of all the complex back-end programming.
  </Accordion>

   <Accordion title="Pre-made components" icon="bolt">
    By pressing `/`, you’ll find all [shadcn/UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components available in a single keystroke. And a lot more are coming.
    For example, typing `/dropdown-menu` will grab the shadcn/UI 'dropdown menu' component. By adding `>>>` you can generate the reference implementation and edit from there. 

    Example with reference implementation: 
    ```
    /button Open menu
    	/dropdown-menu w-56
    		# My account
    		---
    		Profile <Shift + Cmd + P>
    			/icon Single user
    		Billing <Cmd + B>
    			/icon Credit card
    		Settings <Cmd + S>
    		Keyboard shortcuts <Cmd + K>
    		---
    		Team
    			/icon Multiple users
    		Invite users w-40
    			/icon Add a user
    			Email
    			Message 
    				/icon Chat bubble
    			---
    			More...
    				/icon Plus in circle
    		New Team <Cmd + T>
    			/icon Plus
    		---
    		GitHub
    		Support 
    			/icon life saving
    		API @disabled
    			/icon Cloud
    		---
    		Log out <Shift + Cmd + Q>
      ```

    </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Asset Libraries" icon="icons">
 We've included a number of different asset libraries available to users including icons, illustrations, logos and images.
 
 Examples:
  - **✅** `/icon A bear` will find you the closest icon we have to a bear
  - **✅** `/illustration %3d Thumb up emoji` will find you a thumb up emoji in 3d
  - **✅** `/logo Stripe` will find you the Stripe logo
  - **✅** `/image <libraryName>:SpaceX astronauts` will find you (from Unsplash, Google images, etc.) or generate (Dalle-E, Stable diffusion, OpenJourney, etc) an image of SpaceX astronauts (eg `/image openjourney:SpaceX astronauts`)
